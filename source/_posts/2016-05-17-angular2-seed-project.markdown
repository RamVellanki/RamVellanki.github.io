I have been working with Angular2 since it's beta.12 and as Angular2 RC1 got released, I thought of creating a Seed project.

[Here](https://github.com/RamVellanki/ng2-material-tdd-e2e-seed) is the link to the seed project.

Following are the features available in this repository:
* Material2 - Toolbar and Button are included but any other component can be added easily.
* Karma - Basic Karma TDD setup is ready that can be used.
* Protractor - Basic Protractor setup is ready for end to end testing.
* ExpressJS - The project uses ExpressJS.

The repository uses `gulp` and following `npm` tasks are available:
* `npm run dev` - Starts the project in Development mode.
* `npm run prod` - Starts the project in Production mode.
* `npm run test` - Runs Unit Tests.
* `npm run e2e` - Runs end to end Tests.

### Next Steps
I am also working on a JSPM Seed project and will post it sometime soon.
